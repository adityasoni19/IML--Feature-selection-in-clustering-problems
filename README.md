# IML--Feature-selection-in-clustering-problems
This written proposes an algorithm to deal with the feature selection procedure using a
gaussian mixture model in an iterative way. This is called an “ad hoc” strategy. Here the
algorithm iterates the clustering and feature selection. Most discriminative feature for the
object partition is automatically extracted from simultaneous clustering . In our paper the
Gaussian Mixture Model combines clustering method with Bayesian Feature Selection
Mechanism for selecting relevant features.Further an optimization algorithm with
guaranteed convergence to local optimum is applied to the model, having one free
parameter, 𝞳. A stability based model selection procedure is followed for 𝞳.The only free
model parameter is selected by resampling based stability analysis
